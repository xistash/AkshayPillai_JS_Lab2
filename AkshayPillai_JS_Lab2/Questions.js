    question: "Traveling to the past poses more problems than traveling to the future. Many complex obstacles could arise in past time travel, leading physicists to believe that it is impossible. One of the major objections to the possibility of time travel is the Grandfather Paradox What does this paradox state?",

      "There is no Grandfather Paradox",
      "If you traveled to the past, you might run into yourself, but how can there be two of you?"
